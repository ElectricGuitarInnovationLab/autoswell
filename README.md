Autoswell Max for Live devices (Ableton Live 10+) allow you to trigger automated volume swells over time that you might others control manually with a volume pedal. 

With the devices in your Ableton Live set, simply map your MIDI input to the matching MIDI pitch values on the device on the “MIDI Pedal Controller” track OR just map MIDI controller buttons to the buttons on the “Lap Steel Amp” track.
